# Help & Support

There are two ways of getting support with using Superforms:

## Free support

If you're using Superforms in a personal or non-profit project, support is completely free; a star on [Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) is more than enough if you want to show your appreciation. Join [#free-support](https://discord.gg/8X9Wfb2wbz) on Discord and ask away!

## Commercial support

If you're making or aiming to make money on your project, a donation proportional to the current profit of the project or the company you work for, will give you a month of commercial support. Donate with one of the options below, then ask in the [#commercial-support](https://discord.gg/m6hUXE4eNQ) channel on Discord, or [on Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms/issues).

<Sponsor />

For a longer period, you can make a monthly donation. Any $10 or higher monthly donation will be listed on the [Sponsors](/sponsors) page with a picture and link, and on Discord as a Sponsor. Many thanks if you want to support Open Source Software in this way!

## Bug reporting

Please report bugs as an issue [on Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms/issues).

Fixing bugs and working on new features will be handled in due time, but if you want to speed up the process, a donation is welcome, or you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms/pulls), since with open source, we can also pay with our time.
